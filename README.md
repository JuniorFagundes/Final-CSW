###What is PowerSchool and ScorePortal?

From the [PowerSchool](http://www.pearsonschoolsystems.com/products/powerschool/) website: 
> PowerSchool is the fastest-growing, most widely used web-based student information system, supporting 13 million students in all 50 states and over 65 countries.

Here is a screenshot of PowerSchool:

Students are able to easily see all their classes and grades. But it's not the most user-friendly or useful. ScorePortal is an extension of PowerSchool that allows students to visualize their grades graphically, edit or add hypothetical scores, and determine where they need to focus their studies.

The problem is, there's a truckload of data that isn't being used to its full potential. ScorePortal tries to solve that issue by providing students with useful information about their grades. Here's a screenshot of ScorePortal:

We designed ScorePortal to be a much more useful dashboard for all your grades. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please don't hesitate to ask! Thank you for your interest.
